=head1 NAME

Module::Install::TestML - Module::Install Support for TestML

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use inc::Module::Install;

    name     'Foo';
    all_from 'lib/Foo.pm';

    use_testml_tap;

    WriteAll;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds the C<use_testml_tap> directive to Module::Install.

Now you can get full TestML support for your module with no external
dependency on TestML.

Just add this line to your Makefile.PL:

    use_testml_tap;

That's it. Really. Now Test::Base is bundled into your module, so that it is
no longer any burden on the person installing your module.
